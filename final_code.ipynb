    "<h7>Project Title: Student Grades Management System\n",
    "Project Description:\n",
    "This project is a simple Student Grades Management System implemented in Python. The system allows users to manage and track students' grades for various subjects. It includes the following functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding Students and Subjects:\n",
    "Users can input student names and assign subjects along with corresponding grades. The program supports adding multiple subjects for each student, allowing for flexible management of academic records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grade Calculation:\n",
    "The system calculates the average grade for each student based on the subjects and grades entered. It then identifies and displays the student with the highest average grade, designating them as the top student.\n",
    "\n",
    "User Interaction:\n",
    "The program is designed to be interactive, with prompts guiding the user through the process of adding students, subjects, and grades. The user can continue adding subjects for each student until they choose to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features:\n",
    "Dynamic Subject Addition: Users can add as many subjects as needed for each student.\n",
    "Grade Averaging: The system automatically calculates the average grade for each student.\n",
    "Top Student Identification: The program identifies the student with the highest average grade and displays it.\n",
    "Tools Used:\n",
    "Python Programming Language:\n",
    "The entire system is developed using Python, a powerful and versatile programming language that is well-suited for building simple to complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in Data Structures (Dictionaries):\n",
    "The project utilizes Python's dictionary data structure to store student names as keys and their corresponding subjects and grades as values, allowing for efficient data management and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input/Output Functions:\n",
    "The system heavily relies on Python's input() function to interact with the user, allowing them to enter student names, subjects, and grades. The print() function is used to display the results, such as average grades and the top student's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "This system is ideal for small-scale educational institutions or individual use, where manual tracking of student grades is necessary. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage and analyze academic performance.<h>"
